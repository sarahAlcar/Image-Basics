# Aligning images

Scanning is an important process as it allows documents, for example, to be free from damage over time. During this process, however, some kind of misalignment is common. Therefore, for automatic processes of text recognition to be able to act, it is important that this fault be corrected so that the reading is as correct as possible.

In this report, to implement these alignment procedures, strategies based on the Hough transform and horizontal projections wer implemented. Hough's transformation allows us to, given a segmented image, find the segments that constitute a line. This method is based on the maximum cumulative space of the parametric space. In order to implement such a technique, we initially obtained the edges of the image with the Canny method available in python by the feature.canny (img) function. Subsequently, Hough is applied with the hough_line method (edges) returning the Hough accumulator matrix, the angles and the respective distances of the line that intersects the point to the origin. An operation is performed to determine which angle is the most frequent returned. Thus, this returned value is exactly the angle that the image is misaligned being necessary, so rotate that image back to zero degrees.
